# MetalDetecting101
Often, anyone new to or considering the hobby has a lot of questions about getting started. 
I thought it would be nice to have a PDF that answers the most common questions someone new to the hobby often asks.

Get the PDF under releases - https://github.com/MajorGeek/MetalDetecting101/releases or download as a zip file at https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/metal_detecting_101.html
